\section{Preface}

\co{Different phases of matter exist and are determined by the way the atoms are organized.}
Even though all matter consists of atoms, it can appear in various forms and have various properties.
Familiar examples include solids, gases, and liquids; however, more exotic forms exist, such as superfluids, magnets, plasmas, and Boseâ€“Einstein condensates.
These different forms of matter are called phases or states of matter.
The various properties of materials arise from the different phases (ways atoms structure itself in a material).

\co{Symmetry-breaking theory explains how to understand the different phases of matter.}
Symmetry-breaking theory provides a way to understand many of the different phases.
It explains that these different phases correspond to different symmetries in the way the atoms are structured.
Whenever the phase of a material changes (called a phase transition), the symmetry of the organization of the atoms changes.
For example, in a liquid, the atoms are distributed randomly, and it remains a liquid upon moving the atoms by an arbitrary distance: it has a continuous translation symmetry.
When a liquid undergoes a phase transition and turns into a crystal (e.g.~water to ice) the atoms organize into a lattice.
The crystal \textit{only} remains the same if we move the atoms by an exact integer number of the lattice constant (the distance between the smallest repeating pattern): it has a discrete translation symmetry.
This phase transition is an example of symmetry breaking because it reduces the continuous translation symmetry of the liquid to the discrete symmetry of the crystal.
Another example is ferromagnets, where the spins of electrons are randomly oriented above a certain critical temperature $T_c$: having a continuous rotational symmetry; while for $T<T_c$ the spin align: resulting in a discrete rotational symmetry.

\co{Symmetry-breaking theory works well but not for topologically ordered matter.}
This symmetry-breaking theory introduced by Lev Landau in 1937 has been a very successful theory \cite{Landau1937}.  % XXX: Do not say "has been a very successful theory"
It was long believed that the symmetry breaking theory explains all phases in materials and all (continuous) phase transitions.
In 1987, in an attempt to describe high $T_c$ superconductors, the chiral spin state was introduced \cite{Kalmeyer1987}.
However, it was soon realized that the symmetry breaking description was not sufficient to explain its phase.
A new kind of phase called a ``topological phase'' was introduced \cite{Wen1989,XiaoGang1990}.
It is a zero-temperature phase of matter (i.e.~quantum matter) that is described by a robust ground state degeneracy and has quantized non-Abelian geometric phases of degenerate ground states, we discuss what this means in Sec.~\ref{sec:braiding}.

\co{The QHE is an example that can be described using of the theory of topological order.}
The quantum Hall effect is an example of a state that cannot be described by its symmetries alone; instead, it can be characterized by a distinct topology (see Fig.~\ref{fig:knots}).  %XXX: add ref
Its signature, shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:qhe}, is robust does not depend on the specific geometry and does not vanish upon smooth changes in material parameters.
This signature manifests in an exact quantization of the Hall conductance of an integer number of $e^2/h$, where $e$ is the elementary charge, and $h$ is the Planck constant, both fundamental constants in nature.
Because of its robustness---it is insensitive to specific experimental settings and purity of the material used---the quantum Hall effect is used to determine the standard for electrical resistance. % XXX: add ref
The effect appears upon applying a large perpendicular magnetic field $B_\perp$ to two-dimensional electron gas at low temperature.
This opens a gap between the energy bands and localizes the electrons in the bulk.
Classically, we can visualize what happens as electrons localizing in small cyclotron orbits; this leaves the electrons near the edges of the material to bounce along the edges.
These states along the edges are responsible for the conduction and are called ``edge states.''

Topology in mathematics concerns itself with the properties of an object that are preserved under continuous deformations.
For example, an unknot (left) cannot be continuously transformed into a trefoil knot (right) without cutting it; this means that they are not topologically equivalent.
In condensed matter physics, the object that is studied is the Hamiltonian.
Whenever the Hamiltonian can be continuously transformed into another Hamiltonian, they are topologically equivalent.
Unlike a knot that can be visualized in space, the topology of the quantum Hall state manifests itself in momentum space.

\co{More topological states have been realized, one example is TIs.}
The field of topology in condensed matter has substantially grown over the past decades.
Recently, in 2016, the Nobel prize was awarded to Thouless, Haldane, and Kosterlitz for the theoretical findings of topological states.
One of these new states are ``topological insulators,'' which also exhibit edge or surface states and have similarities to the quantum Hall effect, but do not require extreme conditions such as the large magnetic field.
Here, the effect of the magnetic field is replaced by spin-orbit coupling.
This is a coupling between the electron's momentum and spin, effectively causing a momentum dependent magnetic field for electrons that move through a crystal lattice.
The spin-orbit coupling effect is discussed in more detail in Sec.~\ref{sec:hamiltonian_term_by_term}.
Due to the absence of a magnetic field (which breaks time-reversal symmetry in the quantum Hall effect), the edge states always come in counter-propagating pairs, shown in see Fig.~\ref{fig:qhe_example}.

\co{Topological states might be used to build a topological quantum computer.}
In addition to the exciting new physical insights into topological materials, topological states might be used to design novel new quantum devices.
One of the most exciting applications is to use these states to build a topological quantum computer by exploiting their non-Abelian properties.
It is predicted that a quantum computer is much faster than a classical computer in performing certain tasks, such as the simulation of quantum systems \cite{Feynman1982} and prime factorization \cite{Shor1994}.
The fundamental building block of the quantum computer is the qubit (or quantum bit), the quantum equivalent of the classical transistor.
Because these qubits store quantum information, they are extremely fragile, and even a small interaction with its environment can destroy its state and result in computational errors.
Physicists experiment with different approaches to create a qubit; for example, there are proposals (and some realizations of) qubits based on quantum optics, ultracold atoms, spin-based systems, and superconducting systems.  % XXX: add refs
In general, one of the most significant problems is to limit and correct the computational errors, and therefore a large fraction of the research is focussed on error-correction \cite{Lidar2013}.
Here, the advantage of using topological states becomes apparent because the topological qubit naturally protects its state against small perturbations in the environment \cite{Nayak2008}.

\co{Majoranas can be used to create this topological quantum computer.}  % XXX: maybe mention that Majoranas are topologically protected
The simplest non-Abelian excitation is the zero-energy Majorana bound state (MBS), which were first proposed to exist as quasiparticle excitations of the $\nu = 5/2$ quantum Hall effect \cite{Read2000,Moore1991}, which requires a high material purity and very low temperatures.
Other early proposals \cite{Gurarie2005,Sarma2006,Tewari2007} rely on rare and exotic $p$-wave superconductors and are extremely challenging to realize experimentally.
In 2008, Fu and Kane suggested a new approach to create MBSs by using a hybrid structure of an ordinary $s$-wave superconductor coupled to a topological insulator to create a state that resembles a spinless $p$-wave superconductor \cite{Fu2008}.
Inspired by this hybrid approach, in 2010, two works \cite{Lutchyn2010,Oreg2010} suggested using a simpler one-dimensional nanowire system coupled to a $s$-wave superconductor.
This simple model combines spin-orbit coupling, superconductivity, electrostatic tunability, and an applied magnetic field.
When tuned into the right parameter regime, this system hosts MBSs at the edges of the nanowire.
Since its introduction, many experiments have detected signatures of MBSs \cite{Mourik2012,Das2012,Deng2012,Deng2016,Deng2016a,Chen2017a}; however, none have demonstrated the presence of MBSs with absolute certainty by showing its non-Abelian statistics.
Because of the simplicity of the model, it can be solved analytically; however, it neglects many physical phenomena that are crucial for understanding the properties of the MBSs.

\co{In this thesis we study the hybrid Majorana model.}
In this thesis, we study extensions to this model and go beyond the regime that can be studied analytically.
The next sections introduce superconductivity and the topological protection of Majoranas (Sec.~\ref{sec:superconductivity}), non-Abelian statistics (Sec.~\ref{sec:braiding}), the minimal hybrid Majorana model (Sec.~\ref{sec:minimal_majoranas}), and finally, a few extensions to this model (Sec.~\ref{sec:realistic_nanowire}).
At that point, it should be evident that solving this problem requires numerical methods, which is the topic of Sec.~\ref{sec:numerical_methods}.

\section{Topological protection of Majoranas}\label{sec:superconductivity}
\co{To understand the topological protection of MBS in hybrid structures, we discuss superconductivity.}
This section discusses superconductivity to understand the topological protection of Majorana bound states.
Superconductivity is a phenomenon that occurs in certain materials when cooled below a characteristic critical temperature of $T_{\mathrm{C}}$.
Upon reaching this temperature, the material undergoes a phase transition that results in precisely zero electrical resistance and the expulsion of magnetic fields.
Since the discovery of superconductivity by Heike Kamerlingh Onnes in 1911, considerable efforts have been devoted to finding out how and why it works.
A good understanding of ``conventional'' superconductivity was reached by a pair of important theories: the phenomenological Ginzburg-Landau theory and the microscopic BCS theory.
Today's research focuses on exotic superconductors, high $T_{\mathrm{C}}$ superconductors, and hybrid structures that consist of a superconductor and another material.
In this thesis, we study such hybrid structures.

\subsection{BCS theory and the mean-field approximation}\label{sec:BCS-theory}
\co{We can model superconductivity using BCS theory.}
BCS theory describes superconductivity as a microscopic effect and assumes that two electrons from a Cooper pair where the electrons can effectively attract due to electron-phonon coupling \cite{Cooper1956,Bardeen1957,Bardeen1957a}.
It postulates that superconductivity is caused by a condensation of Cooper pairs at the Fermi energy\footnote{We assume zero temperature $\left(T=0\right)$, so $E_{\textrm{F}}=\mu$, where $\mu$ is the chemical potential.} $E_{\textrm{F}}$ into a boson-like state, a Bose Einstein condensate.
The model Hamiltonian in the language of second quantization ~\cite{Gennes1999} equals:

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{H}_{\textrm{BCS}}=\sum_{\bm{k}\sigma}\epsilon_{\bm{k}}c_{\bm{k}\sigma}^{\dagger}c_{\bm{k}\sigma}+\sum_{\bm{k}\bm{l}}V_{\bm{k}\bm{l}}c_{\bm{k}\uparrow}^{\dagger}c_{-\bm{k}\downarrow}^{\dagger}c_{-\bm{l}\downarrow}c_{\bm{l}\uparrow},\label{eq:BCS}
\end{equation}

where

\begin{tabular}{ll}
$c$            & annihilation operator electron,\tabularnewline
$c^{\dagger}$  & creation operator electron,\tabularnewline
$\epsilon_{k}$ & $E_{k}-\mu$,\tabularnewline
$\mu$          & chemical potential,\tabularnewline
$E_{k}$        & kinetic energy ($\frac{\hbar^{2}k^{2}}{2m}$),\tabularnewline
$m$            & mass,\tabularnewline
$k$            & momentum,\tabularnewline
$\sigma\uparrow,\sigma\downarrow$  & spin of electron,\tabularnewline
$V_{\bm{kl}}$  & interaction potential.\tabularnewline
\end{tabular}

The interaction term includes only the Cooper pairs, which consist of two electrons with opposite spin ($s$-wave symmetry) and opposite momentum that can be denoted as $(\bm{\bm{k}}\uparrow,-\bm{k}\uparrow)$.
Finding the ground state of this so-called pairing Hamiltonian is impossible; therefore, we have to make an approximation.  % XXX: is it really impossible?

\co{We use the mean-field approximation and get the Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian and get its spectrum.}
A classic approximation scheme that describes the behaviour of conventional superconductors remarkably well is the mean-field approximation.
First we define the quantity
\begin{equation}
b_{\bm{k}}=\left\langle c_{\bm{k}\uparrow}c_{-\bm{k}\downarrow}\right\rangle ,
\end{equation}
which we use to define the so-called gap energy
\begin{equation}
\Delta_{\bm{k}}=-\sum_{\bm{k'}}V_{\bm{kk'}}b_{\bm{k'}}.
\end{equation}
We write the last term in Eq.~\eqref{eq:BCS} as
\begin{equation}
c_{\bm{k}\uparrow}^{\dagger}c_{-\bm{k}\downarrow}^{\dagger}c_{-\bm{l}\downarrow}c_{\bm{l}\uparrow}=\left(c_{\bm{k}\uparrow}^{\dagger}c_{-\bm{k}\downarrow}^{\dagger}-b_{\bm{k}}^{\dagger}+b_{\bm{k}}^{\dagger}\right)\left(c_{-\bm{l}\downarrow}c_{\bm{l}\uparrow}-b_{\bm{l}}+b_{\bm{l}}\right),\label{eq:MF}
\end{equation}
and expand the products.
We neglect the second-order fluctuation term
\begin{equation}
\left(c_{\bm{k}\uparrow}^{\dagger}c_{-\bm{k}\downarrow}^{\dagger}-b_{\bm{k}}^{\dagger}\right)\left(c_{-\bm{l}\downarrow}c_{\bm{l}\uparrow}-b_{\bm{k}}\right)
\end{equation}
in Eq.~\eqref{eq:MF} and rewrite Eq.~\eqref{eq:BCS} to
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{H}_{\textrm{BCS}_{\textrm{MF}}}=\underset{\bm{k},\sigma}{\sum}\epsilon_{\bm{k}}c_{\bm{k}\sigma}^{\dagger}c_{\bm{k}\sigma}-\underset{\bm{k}}{\sum}\left(\Delta_{\bm{k}}c_{\bm{k}\uparrow}^{\dagger}c_{-\bm{k}\downarrow}^{\dagger}+\Delta_{\bm{k}}^{*}c_{-\bm{k}\downarrow}c_{\bm{k}\uparrow}-\Delta_{\bm{k}}b_{\bm{k}}^{*}\right),\label{eq:BCS_MF}
\end{equation}
where the last term is a constant that can be neglected.
We now introduce Nambu spinors
\begin{equation}
\Psi_{\bm{k}}=\left(\begin{array}{c}
c_{\bm{k}\uparrow}\\
c_{-\bm{k}\downarrow}^{\dagger}
\end{array}\right)\label{eq:Nambu}
\end{equation}
and write Eq.~\eqref{eq:BCS_MF} matrix form
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{H}_{\textrm{BCS}_{\textrm{MF}}}=\underset{\bm{k}}{\sum}\Psi_{\bm{k}}^{\dagger}\underset{H_{\textrm{BdG}}}{\underbrace{\left(\begin{array}{cc}
\epsilon_{\bm{k}} & \Delta\\
\Delta_{\bm{k}}^{*} & -\epsilon_{\bm{k}}
\end{array}\right)}}\Psi_{\bm{k}}.
\end{equation}
To calculate the energy spectrum, we can diagonalize the Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian $H_{\textrm{BdG}}$ using the unitary Boguliubov transformation matrix $U_{\textrm{B}}$.  % XXX: should I mention this?
Alternatively, we can square $H_{\textrm{BdG}}$ which gives a diagonal matrix
\begin{equation}
H_{\textrm{BdG}}^{2}=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
\epsilon_{\bm{k}}^{2}+\left|\Delta\right|^{2} & 0\\
0 & \epsilon_{\bm{k}}^{2}+\left|\Delta\right|^{2}
\end{array}\right),
\end{equation}
where we can use that the eigenvalues are the square root of the eigenvalues of $H_{\textrm{BdG}}$.
This immediately result in the spectrum
\begin{equation}
E=\pm\sqrt{\epsilon_{\bm{k}}^{2}+\left|\Delta\right|^{2}}.\label{eq:SC_spectrum}
\end{equation}

\co{In the single-particle picture, we essentially double the degrees of freedom and introduce a symmetry.}
The Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian acts on the Nambu spinors [Eq.~\eqref{eq:Nambu}] whose first half is composed out of annihilation operators of electrons, and the second half out of creations operators of the same electrons.
To go to a single-particle description (first quantization), we can view the latter creation operators as annihilation operators of an extra set of holes, which doubles the number of degrees of freedom in the system.
Besides the Pauli matrices that act on spin ($\sigma_{i}$ where $i\in x,y,z$) we introduce $\tau_{i}$ to act on the electron-hole degree of freedom.
The Hamiltonian becomes a $4\times4$ matrix\footnote{Here $\otimes$ denotes the Kronecker product and we usually omit $\sigma_{0}$ and $\tau_{0}$.}
\begin{equation}
H_{\textrm{BdG}}=\epsilon_{k}\tau_{z}\otimes\sigma_{0}+\Delta\tau_{x}\otimes\sigma_{0}=\left(\begin{array}{cccc}
\epsilon_{k} & 0 & \Delta & 0\\
0 & \epsilon_{k} & 0 & \Delta\\
\Delta & 0 & -\epsilon_{k} & 0\\
0 & \Delta & 0 & -\epsilon_{k}
\end{array}\right),\label{eq:H_BdG_sc}
\end{equation}
which acts on the wavefunction
\begin{equation}
\Psi=\left(\psi_{\textrm{e}\uparrow},\psi_{\textrm{e}\downarrow},\psi_{\textrm{h}\downarrow},-\psi_{\textrm{h}\uparrow}\right)^{T},\label{eq:4wf}
\end{equation}
where $\psi_{\textrm{e}}$, $\psi_{\textrm{h}}$ are the electron and hole components of the wave function, and $\psi_{\uparrow}$, $\psi_{\downarrow}$ are the spin-up and spin-down states.
Because the holes are related to the electrons, $H_{\textrm{BdG}}$ has a particle-hole symmetry, and it determines the material's specific topology.
Symmetry and its resulting topology is the topic of the next section, after which, we will discuss this particle-hole symmetry.

\subsection{Topology and symmetry}\label{sec:topology}
\co{Symmetry determines a system's topology.}
Symmetry plays a fundamental part in physics.
In condensed matter systems, only three discrete symmetries are important: time-reversal symmetry $\mathcal{T}$, particle-hole symmetry $\mathcal{P}$, and chiral symmetry $\mathcal{C}$.
Wigner's theorem states that a symmetry must either be a unitary or an anti-unitary operator.
Both $\mathcal{T}$ and $\mathcal{P}$ have anti-unitary operators and may square either to $+1$ or $-1$ depending on the specifics of the system.
Chiral symmetries have a unitary operator and always squares to $+1$.
The combination of these three symmetries from ten symmetry classes~\cite{Altland1997}.
Each class is characterized by the absence or presence of these symmetries, and together with the dimensionality of a sytem determines the specific topological invariant it has.
Topology studies whether objects can be continuously transformed into each other.
The object that is studied in condensed matter is the Hamiltonian of a system.
If two Hamiltonians can be continuously transformed\footnote{An example of a continuous transformation from $H_{1}$ to $H_{2}$: $H=\alpha H_{1}+(1-\alpha)H_{2}$ where $\alpha=0\rightarrow1$.} into each other without changing the topological invariant: the systems are said to be topologically equivalent.
How a topological invariant changes, varies for the different symmetry classes.

\co{The PHS relates electrons to holes and this is obvious in its spectrum.}
We ended Sec.~\ref{sec:BCS-theory} by noting that $H_{\textrm{BdG}}$ [Eq.~\eqref{eq:H_BdG_sc}] has a particle-hole symmetry $\mathcal{P}$.
This Hamiltonian acts on a two-component wave function $\psi_{\textrm{BdG}}=\left(u,v\right)^{T}$ with $u$ electron component and $v$ the hole component.
The symmetry of this Hamiltonian is most obvious in its dispersion relation, where each eigenstate $\psi_{E}=\left(u_{0},v_{0}\right)^{T}$ has a particle-hole symmetric partner at $\psi_{-E}=\left(\mathcal{P}u_{0},\mathcal{P}v_{0}\right)^{T}$.
In constructing $H_{\textrm{BdG}}$, we artificially doubled the degrees of freedom by considering electrons and holes separately.
Therefore, the creation operator $c^{\dagger}$ of the quasiparticle in the $\psi_{E}$ state is equal to the annihilation operator $c$ of the quasiparticle in the $\psi_{-E}$ state.
From this, it is clear that $\psi_{E}$ and $\psi_{-E}$ correspond to the same quasiparticle, and the creation of a quasiparticle with positive energy is identical to the annihilation of a quasiparticle with negative energy.
In a one or higher dimensional system, the operator $\mathcal{P}$ will not only send $E \rightarrow -E$ but will also send the momentum $k \rightarrow -k$ as
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{P^{\dagger}}H\left(k\right)\mathcal{P}=-H\left(-k\right).
\end{equation}

\co{At E=0, we get a the Majorana condition.}
At zero energy, something curious happens: here we have a state $\psi_{0}$ that upon applying $\mathcal{P}$ is transforms into itself $\mathcal{P}\psi_{0}=\psi_{0}$.
This state has a creation operator $\gamma^{\dagger}$ that is identical to the annihilation operator $\gamma$ of itself, so $\gamma^{\dagger}=\gamma$.
We call this property the Majorana condition.
If we use the Majorana condition in the fermionic commutation relation
\begin{equation}
\gamma^{\dagger}\gamma+\gamma\gamma^{\dagger}=1
\end{equation}
we get $\gamma^{\dagger}\gamma=1/2$ and see that the Majorana state is always half occupied.
Removing a Majorana from zero energy is, therefore, only possible if it is paired with another Majorana to form a fermionic mode.
Later, in Sec.~\ref{sec:braiding} we make use of this property and show how these Majoranas exhibit non-Abelian statistics.
Subsequently, in Sec.~\ref{sec:minimal_majoranas} we show that it is possible to create Majoranas at two opposite edges of a nanowire where they do not couple and are pinned to $E=0$; this is the so-called topological protection.

\co{Having a PHS means symmetry class D, which in 1D has a Z2 invariant that indicates the presence or absence of Majoranas.}
The symmetry class of the one-dimensional system we study in this thesis has a particle-hole symmetry $\mathcal{P}$, and therefore belongs to class $\mathcal{D}$.
This class has a $\mathcal{Z}_2$ topological invariant $Q$ that is the sign of the Pfaffian of the Hamiltonian: $Q=\sgn\Pf\left(H\right)$.
This invariant can only assume two values ($+1$ or $-1$) and indicates the presence or absence of Majoranas.
\footnote{The Pfaffian for an anti-symmetric matrix is related to the determinant as $\Pf(A)^{2}=\det(A)$.}
This topological invariant is only defined for a system with an energy gap, which means the Hamiltonian of the system has no eigenvalues in a finite interval around zero energy, as in Eq.~\ref{eq:H_BdG_sc}.
If we can continuously transform a Hamiltonian $H_{1}$ into another Hamiltonian $H_{2}$ without ever closing the energy gap, we say $H_{1}$ and $H_{2}$ are topologically equivalent, and thus have the same topological invariant.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% BRAIDING %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\section{Non-Abelian statistics and braiding}\label{sec:braiding}
\co{Majoranas have non-Abelian statistics which is the motivation to study them.}
For many researchers, the ultimate motivation to study Majoranas is the fact that they have a fascinating property, non-Abelian quantum statistics.
Quantum statistic studies what happens to wavefunctions describing identical particles when their positions are exchanged in space.
In introductory quantum mechanics courses, we learned that particles are divided into two classes according to quantum statistics: bosons which stay the same under the exchange and fermions for which the wavefunction changes sign.
However, Majorana bound states do not belong to either of these and are non-Abelian anyons.
The operation of exchanging two Majoranas (called braiding) can send the system into a different state with the same particle configuration.
Explaining how one could experimentally perform a braiding operation is beyond the scope of this thesis; therefore, we will focus on the mathematical operations that describe the braiding process.

\co{Multiple Majoranas form a ground state manifold.}
Exchanging two Majoranas in 1D is ill-defined because it is impossible to swap them without having them collide, which would annihilate them.
We can construct a network of nanowires to form T-junctions (see Fig.~\ref{fig:Majorana-T-junction}), which allows us to exchange positions of Majoranas.
Here, one can temporarily move a Majorana to one of the unoccupied wires and perform the exchange without the Majoranas ever becoming too close to each other.
\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{chapter_introduction/figures/T-junction-network.pdf}
\centering{}
\caption{Majorana T-junction.
The circles represent the Majoranas $\gamma_{1}...\gamma_{6}$.
This network of nanowires allows for the exchange of two Majoranas without having them collide.
This is possible by temporarily bringing a Majorana to one of the
vertical wires and then swapping the position of the other Majorana.
\label{fig:Majorana-T-junction}}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
The only thing that distinguishes Majoranas is their position in the network.
That means that if we exchanged two Majoranas in space, the system would look exactly the same as it looked before the exchange.
We now assume the energy spectrum is gapped for $|E|<\Delta$ with the Majorana ground state at $E=0$.
If this ground state contains several Majoranas, there will be several states all at zero energy, forming a  ``ground state manifold.''

\co{We consider $N$ Majoranas and write down its state of fermionic modes.}
From now on, we only consider the states corresponding to the Majoranas and neglect the states that live in the bulk ($E \geq \Delta$).
As mentioned in Sec.\ref{sec:topology}, a Majorana only has half a degree of freedom, and thus, they can only be assigned quantum states in pairs.
In Fig.~\ref{fig:Majorana-T-junction} we see six Majoranas (3 pairs), but for generality lets consider $N$ pairs.
By pairing two Majoranas (two times half a degree of freedom), we can form fermionic modes that will give us two possible degenerate quantum states, either unoccupied $\ket 0$ or occupied $\ket 1$.
By pairing up neighboring Majoranas $\gamma_{2n-1}$ and $\gamma_{2n}$ we get a creation operator that is its own complex conjugate $c_{n}^{\dagger}=\tfrac{1}{2}(\gamma_{2n-1}+i\gamma_{2n})$, where $c$ is a fermionic creation operator.
Each pair gives two possible quantum states, so $N$ pairs will have $2^{N}$ possible states.
We can represent every such state with a ket
\begin{equation}
\left|s_{1},s_{2},\dots,s_{N}\right\rangle ,
\end{equation}
where $s_{n}$ is either unoccupied $0$ or occupied $1$.
These states form a complete basis of the Hilbert space of the set of Majoranas.

\co{The parity of the groundstate is an observable.}
We define the fermion parity operator
\begin{equation}
P_{n}\equiv1-2c_{n}^{\dagger}c_{n}=i\gamma_{2n-1}\gamma_{2n},
\end{equation}
that acts on the states and where we recognize the $c_{n}^{\dagger}c_{n}$ term as the number operator.
All basis states in the Hilbert space of Majoranas are eigenstates of $P_{n}$.
For example, we have
\begin{subequations}
\begin{equation}
P_{1}\left|0,\dots\right\rangle \ =(1-2c_{1}^{\dagger}c_{1})\left|0,\dots\right\rangle =+\left|0,\dots\right\rangle ,
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
P_{1}\left|1,\dots\right\rangle \ =(1-2c_{1}^{\dagger}c_{1})\left|1,\dots\right\rangle =-\left|1,\dots\right\rangle .
\end{equation}
\end{subequations}
Another essential property of Majoranas is that a pair of Majorana operators all anti-commute with each other.
So
\begin{equation}
(\gamma_{1}\gamma_{2})(\gamma_{3}\gamma_{4})=(\gamma_{3}\gamma_{4})(\gamma_{1}\gamma_{2}),
\end{equation}
but when the pairs share a Majorana they do not commute anymore
\begin{equation}
(\gamma_{1}\gamma_{2})(\gamma_{2}\gamma_{3})=-(\gamma_{2}\gamma_{3})(\gamma_{1}\gamma_{2}).
\end{equation}
In Sec.~\ref{sec:superconductivity} you might have noticed that the total particle number in the Hamiltonian is not conserved; however, the parity is conserved.
The total parity can be obtained by multiplying all parity operators
\begin{equation}
P_{\textrm{tot}}=P_{1}\cdot P_{2}\cdot\,\dots\,\cdot P_{N}=i^{N}\gamma_{1}\gamma_{2}\dots\gamma_{2N}.
\end{equation}
where $P_{\textrm{tot}}$ has eigenvalues $\pm1$.
The parity is an observable and can, therefore, be experimentally measured.

\co{We can deduce the braiding operator that exchanges two Majoranas.}
We can now start to think about what would happen when we exchange two Majoranas~\cite{Ivanov2001}.
Our ground state manifold $\ket\Psi$ will never leave the ground state if we perform the exchange slowly enough.
The exchange of two Majoranas $\gamma_{n}$ and $\gamma_{m}$ will change the ground state $\left|\Psi\right\rangle \to U\left|\Psi\right\rangle $ where $U$ is a unitary operator.
The exact form of $U$ can be derived without a direct calculation.
We do this by assuming that $U$ only depends on the Majoranas involved in the exchange ( $\gamma_{n}$ and $\gamma_{m}$) and by using that the slow exchange does not change the parity of the system because the system stays gapped at all times.
Since the parity is conserved we know: $U$ commutes with the total fermion parity $[U,P_{\textrm{tot}}]=0$, and that $U$ can only depend on the product $i\gamma_{n}\gamma_{m}$.
This product is Hermitian, so we can create a unitary operator by taking the exponential of $i$ times this Hermitian operator as
\begin{equation}
U\equiv\exp(\beta\gamma_{n}\gamma_{m})=\cos(\beta)+\gamma_{n}\gamma_{m}\sin(\beta),
\end{equation}
where $\beta$ is a real coefficient to be determined.
In the last equality we used $(\gamma_{n}\gamma_{m})^{2}=\gamma_{n}\gamma_{m}\gamma_{n}\gamma_{m}=-\gamma_{n}\underset{=1}{\underbrace{\gamma_{m}\gamma_{m}}}\gamma_{n}=-1$
in the Taylor expansion.
We now move to the Heisenberg picture where we look at the evolution of the Majorana operators in time
\begin{subequations}
\begin{equation}
\gamma_{n}\to U\gamma_{n}U^{\dagger}=\left(\cos\beta+\gamma_{n}\gamma_{m}\sin\beta\right)\gamma_{n}\left(\cos\beta+\gamma_{m}^{\dagger}\gamma_{n}^{\dagger}\sin\beta\right)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
=\gamma_{n}\cos^{2}\beta+\left(\gamma_{n}\gamma_{m}^{\dagger}\gamma_{n}^{\dagger}+\gamma_{n}\gamma_{m}\gamma_{n}\right)\sin\beta\cos\beta+\gamma_{n}\gamma_{m}\gamma_{n}\gamma_{m}^{\dagger}\gamma_{n}^{\dagger}\sin^{2}\beta
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
=\gamma_{n}\cos^{2}\beta-\gamma_{n}^{\dagger}\sin^{2}\beta-2\gamma_{m}\sin\beta\cos\beta
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
=\gamma_{n}\cos2\beta-\gamma_{m}\sin2\beta
\end{equation}
\end{subequations}
Similarly we get
\begin{equation}
\gamma_{m}\to U\gamma_{m}U^{\dagger}=\gamma_{m}\cos2\beta+\gamma_{n}\sin2\beta.
\end{equation}
After the exchange happened we know that $\gamma_{m}\to\gamma_{n}$ and $\gamma_{n}\to\gamma_{m}$, this leads to $\beta=\pm\pi/4$.
The two signs make sense; this distinguishes the clockwise and the counterclockwise exchange of the Majoranas.
We now found an operator that exchanges two Majoranas
\begin{equation}
U=\exp\left(\pm\frac{\pi}{4}\gamma_{n}\gamma_{m}\right)=\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(1\pm\gamma_{n}\gamma_{m}\right).\label{eq:U_nm}
\end{equation}

\co{As an example, we apply this operator to the simplest non-trivial case of having just four Majoranas.}
As an example, lets now look at what happens when we have just four Majoranas $\gamma_{1}$, $\gamma_{2}$, $\gamma_{3}$ and $\gamma_{4}$.
The four basis states in the ground state manifold are
\begin{equation}
\left|00\right\rangle ,\left|01\right\rangle ,\left|10\right\rangle ,\left|11\right\rangle ,\label{eq:basis}
\end{equation}
where the first number is the occupation number of the fermionic mode $c_{1}^{\dagger}=\tfrac{1}{2}(\gamma_{1}+i\gamma_{2})$ and the second number the occupation number of $c_{2}^{\dagger}=\tfrac{1}{2}(\gamma_{3}+i\gamma_{4})$.
For instance, if we start from the state $\left|00\right\rangle $ and we exchange $\gamma_{2}$ and $\gamma_{3}$ by applying $U_{23}=\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(1\pm\gamma_{2}\gamma_{3}\right)$, we obtain\footnote{See appendix \ref{chap:U_der} for derivations of $U_{nm}$.}  % XXX: add this to the appendix.
\begin{equation}
\left|00\right\rangle \to U_{23}\left|00\right\rangle =\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\left|00\right\rangle +i\left|11\right\rangle \right).
\end{equation}
Here we see a superposition of states, which is not like bosons or fermions at all, where the exchange can only change the sign.
This property makes Majoranas non-Abelian anyons, and the exchange of two non-Abelian anyons is usually called braiding.
Using these braiding operations, we can create a qubit that can perform a certain set (but not all) of rotations on the single-qubit Bloch sphere.
This means that some of the qubit operations are topologically protected, which reduces the amount of error-correction needed in comparison with a non-topological qubit, and in turn means that fewer physical qubits are required.

\section{Majoranas in a minimal hybrid nanowire}\label{sec:minimal_majoranas}
\co{Superconductivity, spin-orbit coupling, a Zeeman field, and tuned Âµ leads to the appearance of Majoranas near the edges of the wire.}
The combined effect of superconductivity, spin-orbit coupling, and a Zeeman field can lead to the appearance of Majoranas near the edges of the wire~\cite{Lutchyn2010,Oreg2010}.
To understand how this happens, we study the effects of the various terms in the Hamiltonian.
As discussed in Sec.~\ref{sec:topology}, the appearance of Majoranas is a topological effect and is accompanied by the change of the topological invariant $Q$ of symmetry class $\mathcal{D}$.
This invariant can only assume $Q=+1$ (no Majoranas) and $Q=-1$ (Majoranas present) and changes when the band gap closes and reopens.

\label{fig:triv_topo_bandstructure}}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection{The Hamiltonian: term by term}\label{sec:hamiltonian_term_by_term}
\co{We show what the effect of these individual terms is on the band structure.}
The complete model Hamiltonian is rather complicated; therefore, we start with a one-dimensional single band Hamiltonian and study its band structure while adding the terms needed to make a topological band structure and ``engineer'' our way towards Majoranas.
The Hamiltonian in its simplest form is quadratic in momentum and has an off-set in chemical potential $\mu$
\begin{equation}
H=\left(\frac{\bm{p}^{2}}{2m}-\mu\right)\tau_{z},\label{eq:simple_ham}
\end{equation}
where $\tau_{z}$ is a Pauli matrix that acts on the electron-hole substructure.
The band structure for this Hamiltonian with $\mu=-0.3$ is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:triv_topo_bandstructure} (left).
We assume that this band structure is topologically trivial and has $Q=+1$.
Because this Hamiltonian acts trivially in spin-space, the bands in Fig.~\ref{fig:triv_topo_bandstructure} (left) are doubly degenerate.
Finally, the electrons are at positive energy $E$ and the holes on $-E$.

\co{We require a band gap, so we add superconductivity, resulting in a BdG Hamiltonian with a gapped spectrum.}
Next, we raise $\mu$, which shifts the bands [see Fig.~\ref{fig:triv_topo_bandstructure} (middle)].
In Sec.~\ref{sec:topology}, we explained that the topological invariant is only defined for a system with an energy gap.
This band structure has no band gap, and therefore cannot be topological.
Further, in Sec.~\ref{sec:superconductivity} we observed that a BdG Hamiltonian has a gapped spectrum [Eq.~\eqref{eq:SC_spectrum}], so we add $\Delta\tau_{x}$, which results in
\begin{equation}
H_{\textrm{BdG}}=\left(\frac{\bm{p}^{2}}{2m}-\mu\right)\tau_{z}+\Delta\tau_{x},
\end{equation}
and opens a gap because $\tau_{x}$ mixes the electron and holes [see Fig.~\ref{fig:triv_topo_bandstructure} (right)].

\co{We break the spin degeneracy using a magnetic field.}
We are left with a gapped spectrum; however, we closed the band gap twice because of the doubly degenerate spin bands both crossing zero energy simultaneously.
The spin degeneracy (called a Kramers degeneracy\footnote{A Kramers degeneracy would result in two Majoranas per edge (just a fermion).}) is a result of a time-reversal symmetry and needs to be broken to create isolated Majoranas.
To couple to spin we introduce the Zeeman field in the Hamiltonian
\begin{equation}
H_{\textrm{BdG}}=\left(\frac{\bm{p}^{2}}{2m}-\mu\right)\tau_{z}+\Delta\tau_{x}+\frac{1}{2}g\mu_{\textrm{B}}B\sigma_{x},\label{eq:zeeman}
\end{equation}
where $g$ is the LandÃ© factor, $\mu_{\textrm{B}}$ the Bohr magneton, and $B$ magnetic field along $x$, parallel to the wire direction.
In Fig.~\ref{fig:zeeman} we plot the effect of a magnetic field on the band structure and observe that a magnetic field breaks the Kramers degeneracy.
\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{chapter_introduction/figures/zeeman.pdf}
\caption{Band structures of Eq.~\eqref{eq:zeeman} for different values of magnetic field and $\Delta=0.1$, $\mu=0.3$.
\label{fig:zeeman}}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
The bands moving towards each other have opposite spin (orthogonal states), and as we see in Fig.~\ref{fig:zeeman} (middle and left), these spins do not couple.
The problem is that Zeeman conserves spin in $x$-direction, and therefore spin is still a good quantum number.
We know that Majoranas must be spinless because they are their own complex conjugate.

\co{To break spin-rotation symmetry, we introduce the spin-orbit coupling, which by itself is not enough to create Majoranas.}
The solution to this last problem is spin-orbit coupling, which in its simplest form is Rashba: $H_{\textrm{Rashba}}=-\alpha p_{x}\sigma_{y}\tau_{z}$.
The Hamiltonian is now complete and equals
\begin{equation}
H_{\textrm{BdG}}=\left(\frac{\bm{p}^{2}}{2m}-\mu\right)\tau_{z}+\Delta\tau_{x}+\frac{1}{2}g\mu_{\textrm{B}}B\sigma_{x}-\alpha p_{x}\sigma_{y}\tau_{z}.\label{eq:rashba}
\end{equation}
Spin-orbit by itself---eventhough it couples spin---is insufficient to break the Kramers degeneracy.
In Fig.~\ref{fig:SO_no_zeeman}, we see that raising $\alpha$ moves the different spin bands away in either $+k$ or $-k$ direction.
However, a degeneracy remains at $k=0$, revealing why a magnetic field is needed.
\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{chapter_introduction/figures/SO_no_zeeman.pdf}
\caption{Band structures of Eq.~\eqref{eq:rashba} for different values of spin-orbit coupling $\alpha$ and $B=0$, $\Delta=0.1$, $\mu=0.3$.
\label{fig:SO_no_zeeman}}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
Including a magnetic field opens the gap at $k=0$ (see Fig.~\ref{fig:SO_and_zeeman}) making the system topologically nontrivial.
If the system is of a finite length, it will host Majoranas on its edges at $E=0$.

\label{fig:SO_and_zeeman}}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Wavefunction}
We have all the terms in the Hamiltonian to create a topological band structure, which we calculate for an infinite system (i.e., system with a translation symmetry).
To observe Majoranas, we need to diagonalize the Hamiltonian of a finite system with the same parameters that resulted in the topological band structure and plot the wavefunction with the lowest energy: the Majorana wavefunction.
In Fig.~\ref{fig:wavefunction_1d} (left), we see the probability density of the Majorana wavefunction is indeed localized near edges of the nanowire.
The wavefunction decays exponentially with decay length $\xi$.

The Majorana length $\xi$---the decay length of the wavefunction---in the left plot is $\xi=\SI{315}{nm}$.
\label{fig:wavefunction_1d}}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Phase diagrams}

We have seen that a topological band structure leads to Majoranas near the edges of the nanowire.
In the Hamiltonian (Eq.~\eqref{eq:rashba}) we see a few fundamental constants or constants that are material dependent.
However, the chemical potential $\mu$ and magnetic field $B$ can be adjusted in an experiment; asking for which values of $B$ and $\mu$ the system becomes topological is, therefore, a valid question.
In Fig.~\ref{fig:topo_bands} we see a phase diagram, which indicates for which value of $\left(B,\; \mu\right)$ the system is topological.
The colour intensity indicates the size of the topological band gap, which is a measure of the quality of the Majorana.
In Sec.~\ref{sec:phase-diagram}, we explain how to calculate a phase diagram.

In the next chapter, we will extend this model to three dimensions and add the orbital effect of the magnetic field.

\section{Majoranas in a more realistic 3D hybrid nanowire}\label{sec:realistic_nanowire}

In 2D the model Hamiltonian (Eq.~\eqref{eq:rashba}) looks very similar
\begin{equation}
H_{\textrm{BdG}}=\left(\frac{\bm{p}^{2}}{2m}-\mu\right)\tau_{z}+\Delta\tau_{x}+\frac{1}{2}g\mu_{\textrm{B}}B\sigma_{x}+\alpha\left(p_{y}\sigma_{x}-p_{x}\sigma_{y}\right)\tau_{z},\label{eq:2D_Ham}
\end{equation}
where it now also includes the transverse part of the Rashba spin-orbit.
The probability density and band structure of a 2D system are plotted in Fig.~\ref{fig:wavefunction_2d}.

\subsection{Chapter~\ref{ch:orbitalfield}: Orbital effect of magnetic field on the Majorana phase diagram}
Studies of Majorana bound states in semiconducting nanowires frequently neglect the orbital effect of a magnetic field.
Systematically studying its role leads us to several conclusions for designing Majoranas in this system.
Specifically, we show that for experimentally relevant parameter values the orbital effect of a magnetic field has a stronger impact on the dispersion relation than the Zeeman effect.
While Majoranas do not require the presence of only one dispersion subband, we observe that the size of the Majoranas becomes unpractically large, and the band gap unpractically small, when more than one subband is filled.
Since the orbital effect of a magnetic field breaks several symmetries of the Hamiltonian, it leads to the appearance of large regions in parameter space with no band gap whenever the magnetic field is not aligned with the wire axis.
The reflection symmetry of the Hamiltonian with respect to the plane perpendicular to the wire axis guarantees that the wire stays gapped in the topologically nontrivial region as long as the field is aligned with the wire.
\vspace{1mm}

\subsection{Chapter~\ref{ch:supercurrent}: Supercurrent Interference in Few-Mode Nanowire Josephson Junctions}
Junctions created by coupling two superconductors via a semiconductor nanowire in the presence of high magnetic fields are the basis for the potential detection, fusion and braiding of Majorana bound states.
We study NbTiN/InSb nanowire/NbTiN Josephson junctions and find that the dependence of the critical current on the magnetic field exhibits gate-tunable nodes.
This is in contrast with a well-known Fraunhofer effect, under which critical current nodes form a regular pattern with a period fixed by the junction area.
Based on a realistic numerical model we conclude that the Zeeman effect induced by the magnetic field and the spin-orbit interaction in the nanowire are insufficient to explain the observed evolution of the Josephson effect.
We find the interference between the few occupied one-dimensional modes in the nanowire to be the dominant mechanism responsible for the critical current behavior.
We also report a strong suppression of critical currents at finite magnetic fields that should be taken into account when designing circuits based on Majorana bound states.

\subsection{Chapter~\ref{ch:spinorbit}: Spin-Orbit Protection of Induced Superconductivity in Majorana Nanowires}
Spin-orbit interaction (SOI) plays a key role in creating Majorana zero modes in semiconductor nanowires proximity coupled to a superconductor.
We track the evolution of the induced superconducting gap in InSb nanowires coupled to a NbTiN superconductor in a large range of magnetic field strengths and orientations.
Based on realistic simulations of our devices, we reveal SOI with a strength of 0.15--0.35 eV\AA.
Our approach identifies the direction of the spin-orbit field, which is strongly affected by the superconductor geometry and electrostatic gates.

\subsection{Chapter~\ref{ch:shortjunction}: Robustness of Majorana bound states in the short-junction limit}
We study the effects of strong coupling between a superconductor and a semiconductor nanowire on the creation of the Majorana bound states, when the quasiparticle dwell time in the normal part of the nanowire is much shorter than the inverse superconducting gap.
This ``short-junction'' limit is relevant for the recent experiments using the epitaxially grown aluminum characterized by a transparent interface with the semiconductor and a small superconducting gap.
We find that the small superconducting gap does not have a strong detrimental effect on the Majorana properties.
Specifically, both the critical magnetic field required for creating a topological phase and the size of the Majorana bound states are independent of the superconducting gap.
The critical magnetic field scales with the wire cross section, while the relative importance of the orbital and Zeeman effects of the magnetic field is controlled by the material parameters only: $g$ factor, effective electron mass, and the semiconductor-superconductor interface transparency.
