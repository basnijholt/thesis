  abstract  = {This is a review of recent advances in our understanding of how Andreev reflection at a superconductor modifies the excitation spectrum of a quantum dot. The emphasis is on two-dimensional impurity-free structures in which the classical dynamics is chaotic. Such Andreev billiards differ in a fundamental way from their non-superconducting counterparts. Most notably, the difference between chaotic and integrable classical dynamics shows up already in the level density, instead of only in the level-level correlations. A chaotic billiard has a gap in the spectrum around the Fermi energy, while integrable billiards have a linearly vanishing density of states.},
