# Preface
##### Different phases of matter exist and are determined by the way the atoms are organized.
##### Symmetry-breaking theory explains how to understand the different phases of matter.
##### Symmetry-breaking theory works well but not for topologically ordered matter.
##### The QHE is an example that can be described using of the theory of topological order.
##### More topological states have been realized, one example is TIs.
##### Topological states might be used to build a topological quantum computer.

# Topological protection of Majoranas
<!-- this chapter leads up to Majoranas -->
##### Majoranas can be used to create this topological quantum computer.}  % XXX: maybe mention that Majoranas are topologically protecte
##### In this thesis we study the hybrid Majorana model.
##### To understand the topological protection of MBS in hybrid structures, we discuss superconductivity.
##### We can model superconductivity using BCS theory.
##### We use the mean-field approximation and get the Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian and get its spectrum.
##### In the single-particle picture, we essentially double the degrees of freedom and introduce a symmetry.
##### Symmetry determines a system's topology.
##### The PHS relates electrons to holes and this is obvious in its spectrum.
##### At E=0, we get a the Majorana condition.
##### Having a PHS means symmetry class D, which in 1D has a Z2 invariant that indicates the presence or absence of Majoranas.

## Non-Abelian statistics
<!-- This section motivates the research -->
##### Majoranas have non-Abelian statistics which is the motivation to study them.
##### Multiple Majoranas form a ground state manifold.
##### We consider $N$ Majoranas and write down its state of fermionic modes.
##### The parity of the groundstate is an observable.
##### We can deduce the braiding operator that exchanges two Majoranas.
##### As an example, we apply this operator to the simplest non-trivial case of having just four Majoranas.

## Majoranas inside a minimal nanowire
<!-- This section introduces the "Majorana ingredients" -->
##### Superconductivity, spin-orbit coupling, a Zeeman field, and tuned µ leads to the appearance of Majoranas near the edges of the wire.
##### We show what the effect of these individual terms is on the band structure.
##### We require a bandgap, so we add superconductivity, resulting in a BdG Hamiltonian with a gapped spectrum.
##### We break the spin degeneracy using a magnetic field.
##### To break spin-rotation symmetry, we introduce the spin-orbit coupling, which by itself isn't enough to create Majoranas.

## Majoranas in a more realistic 3D nanowire
<!-- Here we make the model more realistic -->
##### Experiment does not agree, so we need to include more physical effects.
##### In 3D more orbitals are present, breaking the simple E_z²>µ²+Δ² requirement for Majoranas.
##### Whenever a magnetic flux can penatrate the nanowire, the canonical momentum operator is modified to include the vector potential.
##### A real system's material is not perfectly smooth and has impurities, we can model this disorder by random onsite energy.
##### Proximity SC, k.p, electrostatics.
