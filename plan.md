# Preface
<!-- We briefly discuss the following things -->
##### Phase transitions often involve a symmetry breaking process
##### Methods to study them where developed in the 40s by Landau.
##### In the 80s the QHE was discovered, which challenged that method because the transition doesn't arise from a change in symmetry.
##### Rather, QHE can be explained by topology, and does not depend of specific geometry.
##### In 1985 and 2016 the Nobel price was awarded for QHE and theoretical findings of topological states, respectively
##### The field of topology in condensed matter has grown over the past decades.
##### Discoveries include, TIs, that have similarities with QHE.
##### These materials can be used to build a topological quantum computer.
##### In 2008, Fu and Kane predicted that TI+sc supports Majorana zero modes, which are {insert explaination}.
##### Later it was found that Majoranas can be created inside a sc + sm hybrid nanowire device.
##### The experimental discovery has led to much interest to use them for QC.
##### Realistic modeling is needed to understand the proporties of the Majoranas in real devices.

# Topological protection of Majoranas
<!-- this chapter leads up to Majoranas -->
##### Superconductivity is explained by microscopic BCS theory and today's research includes hybrid structures.
##### The BCS Hamiltonian in terms of second quantization is ...
##### We can make a mean-field approximation and write the Hamiltonian as a BdG Hamiltonian.
##### This Hamiltonian has a symmetry.
##### The abscence or presence of it of implies that a certain physical property of that system is conserved.
##### The BdG Hamiltonian has a PHS.
##### At zero energy, applying a PHS operator, a state is transformed into itself, resulting in the Majorana condition.
##### In a 1D system with PHS we can calculate whether these Majoranas are present (called the topological invariant) using the Pfaffian.

## Non-Abelian statistics
<!-- This section motivates the research -->
##### The reason to study Majoranas are its non-Abelian quantum statistics.
##### Exchanging two Majoranas changes the state.
##### The BdG Hamiltonian from prev chapter does not conserve particle number, but conserves parity.
##### We can write down a unitary operator that commutes with the parity operator and we show what happens when we exchange two Majoranas.

## Majoranas inside a minimal nanowire
<!-- This section introduces the "Majorana ingredients" -->
##### Superconductivity, spin-orbit coupling, a Zeeman field, and tuned µ leads to the appearance of Majoranas near the edges of the wire.
##### We show what the effect of these individual terms is on the band structure.
##### Changing µ in a Hamiltonian with electrons and holes will shift the bands in energy.
##### Adding superconductivity creates a gapped band structure.
##### A magnetic field will break Kramers's degeneracy.
##### Spin-orbit coupling breaks spin-rotation symmetry.
##### By tuning these parameters such that E_z²>µ²+Δ², Majoranas appear, and in a finite length system we can plot its wavefunction.

## Majoranas in a more realistic 3D nanowire
<!-- Here we make the model more realistic -->
##### Experiment does not agree, so we need to include more physical effects.
##### In 3D more orbitals are present, breaking the simple E_z²>µ²+Δ² requirement for Majoranas.
##### Whenever a magnetic flux can penatrate the nanowire, the canonical momentum operator is modified to include the vector potential.
##### A real system's material is not perfectly smooth and has impurities, we can model this disorder by random onsite energy.
##### Proximity SC, k.p, electrostatics.
