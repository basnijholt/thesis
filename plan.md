# Preface
<!-- We briefly discuss the following things -->
##### Dirac introduced particle/anti-particles using his equation.
##### Majorana found an alternative solution, predicting Majorana fermions.
##### Majorana fermions have not been found; however, in condensed matter physics there are Majorana bound states (MBS) in superconductors.
##### In 2D they have non-Abelian exchange statistics, so they are useful for quantum computing.

# Superconductivity
<!-- this chapter leads up to Majoranas -->
##### Superconductivity is explained by Ginzburg-Landau theory and the microscopic BCS theory and today's research includes hybrid structures.
##### The BCS Hamiltonian in terms of second quantization is ...
##### We can make a mean-field approximation and write the Hamiltonian as a BdG Hamiltonian.
##### This Hamiltonian has a symmetry.
##### Symmetry is important both in classical and quantum physics.
##### The abscence or presence of it of implies that a certain physical property of that system is conserved.
##### The BdG Hamiltonian has a PHS.
##### At zero energy, applying a PHS operator, a state is transformed into itself, resulting in the Majorana condition.
##### In a 1D system with PHS we can calculate whether these Majoranas are present (called the topological invariant) using the Pfaffian.

# Majoranas

## Motivation to study Majoranas: non-Abelian statistics
<!-- This section motivates the research -->
##### The reason to study Majoranas are its non-Abelian quantum statistics.
##### Exchanging two Majoranas changes the state.
##### In 1D exchanging two Majoranas is not possible, so we need to create T-junctions.
##### The BdG Hamiltonian from prev chapter does not conserve particle number, but conserves parity.
##### We can write down a unitary operator that commutes with the parity operator and we show what happens when we exchange two Majoranas.

## Majoranas inside a minimal nanowire
<!-- This section introduces the "Majorana ingredients" -->
##### Superconductivity, spin-orbit coupling, a Zeeman field, and tuned µ leads to the appearance of Majoranas near the edges of the wire.
##### We what the effect of these individual terms is on the band structure.
##### Changing µ in a Hamiltonian with electrons and holes will shift the bands in energy.
##### Adding superconductivity creates a gapped band structure.
##### A magnetic field will break Kramer's degeneracy.
##### Spin-orbit coupling breaks spin-rotation symmetry.
##### By tuning these parameters such that E_z²>µ²+Δ², Majoranas appear, and in a finite length system we can plot its wavefunction.

## Majoranas in a more realistic 3D nanowire
<!-- Here we make the model more realistic -->
##### In 3D more orbitals are present, breaking the simple E_z²>µ²+Δ² requirement for Majoranas
##### Whenever a magnetic flux can penatrate the nanowire, the canonical momentum operator is modified to include the vector potential.
##### A real system's material is not perfectly smooth and has impurities, we can model this disorder by random onsite energy
