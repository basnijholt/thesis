\begin{enumerate}

\item Computationally expensive low dimensional parameter sweeps of a smooth space always benefit from adaptively sampling its parameter space. (Chapter~\ref{ch:adaptive})

\item The orbital effect of the magnetic field has a larger effect on the Majorana phase diagram than the Zeeman effect for experimentally relevant parameters. (Chapter~\ref{ch:orbitalfield})

\item Josephson junctions formed in semiconducting nanowires are very sensitive to the microscopic details and therefore are a unreliable tool in studying Majorana bound states. (Chapter~\ref{ch:supercurrent})

\item Measuring the conductance in Majorana nanowires as a function of bias voltage and a magnetic field in different directions reveals the presence of spin-orbit coupling. (Chapter~\ref{ch:spinorbit})

\item Cutting off long trajectories using the device geometry in two-dimensional Majorana Josephson junctions improves the Majorana properties in a more controllable way than by doing the same using disorder (Chapter~\ref{ch:zigzag}, A. Haim and A. Stern, (2019), Phys. Rev. Lett. 122, 126801)

\item The size of the Majorana bound states and the critical magnetic field required for creating them are both independent of the superconducting gap in a proximitized device. (Chapter~\ref{ch:shortjunction})

\item Our best short term option to combat climate change and minimize our dependence on fossil fuels; is to build more nuclear reactors of the newest generations.

\item Psychedelic drugs that pose no health risks, such as LSD or psilocybin mushrooms, should be legalized, and it should be possible to use them in therapy sessions as an alternative to conventional drugs.

\item Psychological support should be offered to all Ph.D. students by default to minimize the risk of developing psychological disorders and, consequently, Ph.D. dropout rates.

\item Publishing the data and source code used in an article's figures or findings should become obligatory to benefit the advancement of science.

\item Theoretical physics departments should hire more women, even if a better qualifying man is available because it increases the number of female role models, which in turn inspires more women to stay in an academic career in physics.

\item All research that is funded by the taxpayer's money should be available the public without paying for it again, with the exception of research that poses security or privacy risks.

\item The Dutch government should increase taxes on meat products proportional to the greenhouse emissions of its production to stimulate people to deviate from the environmentally unsustainable meat-based diet.

\item All recreational drugs that have an addiction potential and health impact lower than drinking alcohol or smoking should be legalized.

\item The amount of success in one's Ph.D. depends more on one's ability to collaborate than intelligence.

\item All scientific educational programs should focus more on teaching programming as a tool to conduct research.
