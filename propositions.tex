\begin{enumerate}

\item Computationally expensive low dimensional parameter sweeps of a smooth space always benefit from adaptively sampling its parameter space. (Chapter~\ref{ch:adaptive})

\item The orbital effect of the magnetic field has a larger effect on the Majorana phase diagram than the Zeeman effect for experimentally relevant parameters. (Chapter~\ref{ch:orbitalfield})

\item Using the supercurrent to study Majorana bound states in hybrid semiconducting-superconducting nanowires leads to weak conclusions due to the sensitivity on parameters. (Chapter~\ref{ch:supercurrent})

\item By measuring the conductance in Majorana nanowires as a function of bias voltage and a magnetic field in different directions, it is possible to determine the presence of spin-orbit coupling. (Chapter~\ref{ch:spinorbit})

\item Cutting off long trajectories using the device geometry in two-dimensional Majorana Josephson junctions improves the Majorana properties in a more controllable way than by doing the same using disorder (Chapter~\ref{ch:zigzag})

\item The critical magnetic field required for creating a topological phase and the size of the Majorana bound states in devices in the short-junction limit are both independent of the superconducting gap. (Chapter~\ref{ch:shortjunction})

\item Our best short term option to combat climate change and minimize our dependence on fossil fuels; is to build more nuclear reactors of the newest generations.

\item The more controversial a defendant's propositions are, the easier a Ph.D. defense is.

\item Psychedelic drugs that pose no health risks, such as LSD or psilocybin mushrooms, should be legalized, and it should be possible to use them in therapy sessions as an alternative to conventional drugs.

\item Psychological support should be more readily available in academia to minimize the effects of psychological disorders and, consequently, Ph.D. dropout rates.

\item Publishing the data and source code used in an article's figures or findings should become obligatory to benefit the progression of science.

\item Theoretical physics departments should hire more women, even if a better qualifying man is available because it increases the number of female role models, which in turn inspires more women to stay in an academic career in physics.

\item All research that is funded by the taxpayer's money should be available to those taxpayers without paying for it again.
