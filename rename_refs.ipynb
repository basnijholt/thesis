      "\n",
      "Spin-orbit interaction (SOI) is a relativistic effect that results from electrons moving (orbit) in an electric field ($E$) experiencing a magnetic field ($B_{\\mathrm{SO}}$) in their moving reference frame that couples to the electron's magnetic moment (spin).\n",
      "SOI is an essential ingredient of various realizations of topological superconductors, which host Majorana zero modes, the building blocks of topological quantum computation \\cite{Kitaev2001,Fu2008,Nayak2008}.\n",
      "The prime platform for topological quantum computation is based on a semiconductor nanowire coupled to a superconductor, where the proximity effect opens a superconducting energy gap in the density of states of the nanowire \\cite{Lutchyn2010,Oreg2010}.\n",
      "In general, a magnetic field suppresses superconductivity by closing the superconducting gap due to Zeeman and orbital effects \\cite{Nijholt2016}.\n",
      "If the nanowire has strong SOI, suppression of the superconducting gap is counteracted and a sufficiently large Zeeman energy drives the system into a topological superconducting phase, with Majorana zero modes localized at the wire ends \\cite{Lutchyn2010,Oreg2010}.\n",
      "The main experimental effort in the last few years has focused on detecting these Majorana zero modes as a zero-bias peak in the tunneling conductance \\cite{Mourik2012,Albrecht2016,Deng2016,Guel2018,Zhang2018,Lutchyn2018,Aguado2017}.\n",
      "However, SOI, the mechanism providing the topological protection, has been challenging to detect directly in Majorana nanowires.\n",
      "\n",
      "The electric field that gives rise to SOI in our system mainly results from structural inversion asymmetry of the confinement potential (Rashba SOI), which depends on the work function difference at the interface between the nanowire and the superconductor and on voltages applied to nearby electrostatic gates \\cite{Vuik2016,Antipov2018,Woods2018,Mikkelsen2018}.\n",
      "The Rashba SOI in nanowires has been investigated extensively by measuring spin-orbit related quantum effects: level repulsion of quantum dot levels \\cite{Fasth2007,Nadj-Perge2012}, and of Andreev states \\cite{Moor2018,Deng2016}, weak antilocalization in long \\mbox{diffusive} wires \\cite{Hansen2005,Weperen2015}, and a helical liquid signature in short quasiballistic wires \\cite{Kammhuber2017}.\n",
      "However, the SOI strength relevant to the topological protection is affected by the \\mbox{presence} of the superconductor, necessitating direct observation of SOI in Majorana nanowires.\n",
      "Here, we reveal SOI in an InSb nanowire coupled to a NbTiN superconductor through the dependence of the superconducting gap on the magnetic field, both strength and orientation.\n",
      "We find that the geometry of the superconductor on the nanowire strongly modifies the direction of the spin-orbit field, which is further tunable by electrostatic gating, in line with the expected modifications of the electric field due to work function difference and electrostatic screening at the nanowire-superconductor interface.\n",
      "\n",
      "Figure 1(a) shows the device image.\n",
      "An InSb nanowire (blue) is covered by a NbTi/NbTiN superconducting contact (purple) and a Cr/Au normal metal contact (yellow).\n",
      "The barrier gate underneath the uncovered wire (red) can deplete the nanowire, locally creating a tunnel barrier.\n",
      "The tunneling differential conductance ($dI/dV$) resolves the induced superconducting gap, by sweeping the bias voltage ($V$) across the tunnel barrier [Fig. 1(b)].\n",
      "The dashed arrow indicates the induced gap of 0.65 meV.\n",
      "In this device, we have recently shown ballistic transport and Majorana signatures \\cite{Guel2018}.\n",

      "The magnetic field ($B$) dependence of the induced gap of device $A$, with $B$ along three different directions, is shown in Fig. 1(e).\n",
      "The coordinate system is illustrated in Fig. 1(c).\n",
      "The $x$ axis is along the nanowire, parallel to the electron momentum ($k$).\n",
      "The $z$ axis is perpendicular to the substrate and coincides with the electric field ($E$) direction due to the spatial symmetry of the device and the bottom gate.\n",
      "Since the Rashba spin-orbit field ($B_{\\mathrm{SO}}$ $\\propto$ $E$ $\\times$ $k$) is perpendicular to both $k$ and $E$, it points along the $y$ axis.\n",
      "When $B$ is aligned with $x$ or $z$ [left and right panels in Fig. 1(e)], both perpendicular to $B_{\\mathrm{SO}}$, the gap closes \\mbox{slowly} (at around 0.6 T), followed by the emergence of a zero-bias peak possibly characteristic of a Majorana zero mode when $B$ is along the nanowire, although we emphasize that a conjecture of Majorana zero modes is not essential for the purposes of this chapter.\n",
      "On the contrary, when $B$ is aligned with the $y$ axis (middle panel), parallel to $B_{\\mathrm{SO}}$, the gap closes much faster (at around 0.25 T).\n",
      "Figure 1f shows the line cuts at $|B|$ $=$ 0.25 T along the three axes: for $B$ $\\perp$ $B_{\\mathrm{SO}}$, the gap is almost the same as when $B$ $=$ 0 T, while the gap is closed for $B$ $\\parallel$ $B_{\\mathrm{SO}}$.\n",

      "To find an analytical expression for the dependence of the gap closing on $\\alpha$, we start from the conventional one-dimensional Majorana nanowire Hamiltonian \\cite{Lutchyn2010,Oreg2010}, in which the gap size is given by the lowest energy eigenstate:\n",
